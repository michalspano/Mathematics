# Study Resources by @michalspano

This repositery contains a collection of **study resources** that I have
written or compiled over the years. The resources are mainly focused on the
following topics:

- **Mathematics** (Algebra, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics)
- **Computer Science** (Algorithms, Data Structures, Programming Languages)
- **Programming** (Python, Haskell, Java)
- **etc.**

Feel free to use these resources for your own study purposes. If you find any
errors or have suggestions for improvement, please let me know by creating an
issue or pull request. Read the [**MIT License**][license] for more
information.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the documents are written in the Slovak language. I will try to
> translate them into English in the future.
