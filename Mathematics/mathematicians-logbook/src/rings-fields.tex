\section{Rings, Fields}

\newcommand{\N}{\mathbb{N}}
\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}
\newcommand{\Q}{\mathbb{Q}}

The following demonstrates a trivial discussion of \textbf{rings, fields} on
the number sets \(\N, \Z, \Q\).

\subsection{Rings, fields on $\N$}

We try define a commutative group \(\la \N, \op \ra\). However, this is not
possible, because $\op$ does not have an additive inverse defined on $\N$.
Hence, \(\langle \N, \op \rangle\) fails to be a (commutative) group, so it
cannot be a ring neither a field.

\subsection{Rings, fields on $\Z$}

Similarly, we try define a commutative group \(\la \Z, \op \ra\). We observe
that this is possible with an identity $0$. Furthermore, $\oo$ is commutative,
associative and has an identity $1$. According to the \verb|DEF|, \(\la \Z,
\op, \oo \ra\) is a commutative ring. However, the operation $\oo$ does not 
have multiplicative inverses on \(\Z \backslash 0\), so it cannot be a field.

\subsection{Rings, fields on $\Q$}

Clearly, \(\la \Q, \op, \oo \ra\) is a commutative ring. Also, $\oo$ contains
multiplicative inverses on \(\Q \backslash 0\), so \(\la \Q, \op, \oo \ra\)
must be a field based on \verb|DEF|.

\subsection{Exercises}

\exercise Let \(\la F, \op, \oo \ra\) be a field. Prove that the
following holds about the field

\[
 \forall a,b,c,d \in F: \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bc}, b, c, d
 \neq 0
\] % TODO: solve this exercise.
